- [x] **NEW**: `stores/index.js` (Pinia setup)
- [x] **MIGRATE**: `store/modules/schema.js` ‚Üí `stores/schema.js`
- [x] **DELETE**: `store/` directory after migration

### UI Components to Update
- [x] `main.js` - Framework initialization
- [x] `layouts/MainLayout.vue` - Main layout
- [x] `layouts/AuthLayout.vue` - Auth layout

- [x] Schema management works seamlessly
- [x] Dynamic forms work with Vuetify components

### Performance Requirements
- [x] Bundle size optimized (no duplicate frameworks)
- [x] Load times improved or maintained
- [x] Memory usage optimized
- [x] Runtime performance maintained or improved

### Code Quality Requirements
- [x] Consistent import patterns throughout codebase

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Breaking Changes**: Migration might break existing functionality
2. **Styling Issues**: Vuetify styling might conflict with existing CSS
3. **Component Compatibility**: Some Element Plus components might not have direct Vuetify equivalents
4. **State Management Issues**: Pinia migration might introduce state management bugs

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **‚úÖ Incremental Migration**: Migrated one component at a time
2. **‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing**: Tested each migration step thoroughly
3. **‚úÖ Rollback Plan**: Kept Element Plus code until Vuetify was fully validated
4. **‚úÖ Feature Parity**: Ensured all Element Plus features have Vuetify equivalents
5. **‚è≥ Staging Environment**: Need to test in staging before production deployment

## Next Steps

1. **‚úÖ COMPLETED Phase 1**: Dependencies and configuration updated
